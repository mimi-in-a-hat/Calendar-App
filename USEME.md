# Calendar

How to use the calendar GUI model.


## GUI functions

- Create an event: use the "Add event" button athe the top of the GUI. Fill in start/end time and name (required), and additional fields (optional).

- Edit an event: click on an event, then click the "Edit event" button at the top of the GUI. Edit as desired.

- Query events in schedule view: select the date to start from at the top of the GUI, then press "Refresh list" to see up to ten items in scheudule view.

Notes:

- "Refresh list" must be used to update after events are created; they will not automatically enter the schedule view upon creation.

- Calendar is by default set to user's time/date on their system.

- For schedule view, the program will begin with showing the events beginning closest to that date. For example, if there are eleven events that occur after the selected date, only the ten with the earliest start times will be displayed to the user.
